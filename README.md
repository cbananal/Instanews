###The Experience / Learning Outcomes
This was a challenging project as it was the very first time I learned about Ajax / JSON / APIs. It is an interesting concept and knowing what it does and why it's important helped me to eventually make sense of what to code, and why. Again, it was a great practice for hand-coding jQuery; It pushed me to think like I never had before, to always consider what could possibly go wrong, and how to counter that when that happens. I enjoyed learning about it and will continue doing so.

With this project, we were also introduced to SASS, dev environments, task runners and version control. I didn't know that side of coding/programming before and it was really nice and interesting to step up and use these working aids.

Beyond that, we were also tasked for the first time to critique the code of a classmate and give feedback. It was a good alternative to learning how to read other people's code and getting around Github (i.e. forking, opening issues, creating pull requests, etc.).
