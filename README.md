##Learning Outcomes
This was a challenging project as it was the very first time I learned about Ajax / JSON / APIs. It is an interesting concept and knowing what it does and why it's important helped me to eventually make sense of what to code, and why. Again, it was a great practice for hand-coding jQuery; It pushed me to think like I never had before, to always consider what could possibly go wrong, and how to counter that when that happens. I enjoyed learning about it and will continue doing so.

With this project, we were also introduced to SASS, dev environments, task runners and version control. I didn't know that side of coding/programming before and it was really nice and interesting to step up and use these working aids.
